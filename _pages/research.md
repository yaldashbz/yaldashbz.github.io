### Research Intern at [Image and Visual Representation Lab, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/)
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EX3OYP4AAAAJ&hl=en)

- Performed data labeling for a specialized comic dataset using Segment Anything (SAM).
- Used Mask2Former as the mask classification method and Deeplabv2 as the per-pixel classification method.
- Implemented dataset registration and fine-tuning by freezing different parts of the models in the Detectron2 framework.


### Research Intern at [Visual Intelligence for Transportation, EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/)
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Alexandre Alahi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UIhXQ64AAAAJ&hl=en)

- Used optical flow methods to convert Video to 1-D signal for sudden movement detection in Rapid Eye Movement Behavior Disorder. Then I explored different anomaly detection methods and used Isolation Forest for detecting anomalies in converted signals.
- Explored domain adaptation methods & conduct fine-tuning unsupervised keypoint detection methods on infrared datasets.


### Research Intern at [Robust/Interpretable ML Lab, Sharif](https://github.com/rohban-lab)
**Supervisor:** [Prof. Mohammad Hossein Rohban](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pRyJ6FkAAAAJ&hl=en)

- **Diffusion on [MIDOG challenge](https://midog2022.grand-challenge.org/)**
  - Domain Generalization with score-based SDE diffusion model
  - Checking improvement on Cell detection methods

- **Optimizing Adversarial Training through High-to-Low Resolution Mapping**
  - Optimized a specific adversarial training setting by mapping high-res data to low-res low-rank decomposition techniques. 

- **Generalized Anomaly Detection**
  - Explored state-of-the-art methods and addressing challenges in localized anomaly detection across CIFAR and MVTecAD datasets. 
  - Collaborated on developing a generalized solution using innovative hard-attention architecture.
