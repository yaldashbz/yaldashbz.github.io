I’m Yalda, a last year bachelor's Computer Engineering student at <a href="https://en.sharif.edu/">Sharif University of Technology</a><br>

My research interests lie in the area of:</p>

<ul style="margin-top: -1%;" markdown='1'>
<li> Machine Learning & Deep Learning </li>
<li> Generalization & Robustness </li>
<li> Domain Adaptation & Transfer Learning </li>
</ul>

Throughout my undergraduate studies, I've had the opportunity to work with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UIhXQ64AAAAJ&hl=en"> Professor Alexandre Alahi</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EX3OYP4AAAAJ&hl=en"> Professor Sabine Süsstrunk</a> at EPFL, along with multiple research experience at Sharif University.

I have working experience on:
